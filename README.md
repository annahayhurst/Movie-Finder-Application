# MovieFinder Application

A coursework project for a university programming module. The spec is as follows: 

*Movie rating systems are used for evaluating movies, analysing user preferences or
recommendation. Popular entertainment streaming platforms such as Netflix,
Amazon Video or Sky store ratings from their subscribed users while others such as
Film Affinity and Movilens collect ratings from individuals around the world.
You are provided with csv files containing usersâ€™ information, movies and their
ratings.*

*Your mission is to build a Simple Movie Information System that stores and
manages the movie ratings wherein individual users can log in, select, and rate a
movie. The system should also enable visualisation of individual movie details and
aggregated ratings of all the available movies inside your system.*

This is fulfilled in three main steps:

+ User management system that allows new users to register
+ Movie management functionality allowing movies to be added/deleted, sorted by average rating, and search by title
+ Implementation of a user friendly GUI that implements basic HCI concepts

The end goal is to have a standalone application in the form of a JAR file that can be loaded and works with persistent data
 (stored in files rather than a database).
 
 I will be adding commits to this repository as I make progress, and tagging releases when key components of functionality are completed.
